                    <p>Johnson Plastics Plus is a leading supplier of engraving, printing and signmaking products. Since 1970, JPPlus has exceled in growing their product catalog to feature tens of thousands of products ready to be engraved, printed and personalized.</p>
                    <p>I was the UI/UX designer and frontend developer for JPPlus from late 2018 to early 2022, and I redesigned, optimized and coded everything from primary components like navigation and megamenu, to pages like PDP, category, cart, checkout and plenty of marketing landing pages.</p>
                    <p>During my time with the company, JPPlus ecommerce sales grew immensely, along with concurrent web traffic. Our goal was to significantly migrate phone sales to web sales, and provide more information and resources for customers online. The year-by-year data showed that we succeeded in these efforts, by web sales surpassing the desired percentage of all sales, and by our custom-built Resource Center answering frequently-asked questions that were previously called in to customer support.</p>
