// SCSS Best Practices

const scssBestPractices = `

0. Every time you are about to engage in changes to the code, ask yourself if it is directly related to achieving the request that was made.
1. Use elegant and modern design.
2. On mobile, when necessary, have sibling cards be swipeable horizontally instead of stacked vertically.
3. Use SCSS variables rather than CSS variables.
4. Use @use and @forward instead of @import, and no namespacing for scss files and variables.
5. For scss index files, use @forward to forward all partials to the main index file.
6. If you make adjustments to variable names, double check the repo to make sure the old variables are not used elsewhere, and if so are also updated.
7. Do not split class names via scss nesting. When using scss nesting, use entire class names.
