// JS Libraries Best Practices

const jsLibrariesInstructions = `
1. Use elegant and modern design, we want soft and smooth animations.
2. Use GSAP for animations.
3. Use split-type for text animations, not gsap SplitText.
4. Use Lenis for smooth scrolling, not GSAP SmoothScroller.
5. Use Three.js for GLSL shaders and 3D animations.
6. Use Barba.js for seamless page transitions.
7. Use KeenSlider for slider components.
8. When we create new visual effects with three.js, also give us GUI controls to be able to adjust parameters of the shaders and other effects.
